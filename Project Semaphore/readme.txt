Single File Program
-------------------

Single file program means each program is constructed by an individual source code file.
You can store several source code files in the same folder. They will be sharing the same .vscode folder

The program exe file will be based on the source code file.
For example, 
	console_example.cpp will be compiled to console_example.exe
	graphic_example.cpp will be compiled to graphic_example.exe

1. To get started working with this mode (i.e. single file program), you simply open the parent folder into MS VS Code.
2. To run a particular program, open the corresponding source code file and choose the Debug settings: "console program" (for console program) or "winbgim program" (for graphic program)
